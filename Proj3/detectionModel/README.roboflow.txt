Roboflow is an end-to-end computer vision platform that helps you
* collaborate with your team on computer vision projects
* collect & organize images
* understand and search unstructured image data
* annotate, and create datasets
* export, train, and deploy computer vision models
* use active learning to improve your dataset over time

The dataset includes 306 images.
Legos-robots-obstacles are annotated in YOLO v5 PyTorch format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* Randomly crop between 0 and 10 percent of the image
* Random rotation of between -15 and +15 degrees
* Random shear of between -10째 to +10째 horizontally and -5째 to +5째 vertically
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -20 and +20 percent
* Random exposure adjustment of between -8 and +8 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 3 pixels
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 3 percent of pixels
